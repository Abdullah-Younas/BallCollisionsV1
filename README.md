**BALLS AND COLLISIONS**
Today or For two days i worked on creating balls and collisions between them, at first i though this stuff was easy that finding collision overlaps was easy and that was TRUE but the real evil stuff was collision responses and how to code them.This
really made me sick.
But with some help of CHATGPT I was able to do it, Since it's my first try it is'nt optimized or stuff that's for later so here are three raw footages:
